          <li>"Dash has crazy cat lady vibes but she means well."</li>
          <li>"When I came home Dash was applying urine to a cut my child received on her scooter. Though I'm glad she sterylized the wound she should be prepared for a situation like this with a first aid kit. I probably wouldn't hire her."</li>
          <li>"She thought my child was too old to still be using a pacifier so she dipped it in tobasco. My child doesn't use a pacifier anymore. I guess it's for the best."</li>
